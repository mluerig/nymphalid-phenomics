This repository contains the analytical pipeline and code to reproduce the results of the paper "Aposematic color patterns are the dominant axis of phenotypic diversification in Nymphalid butterflies" (LÃ¼rig et al. 2025). The pipeline combines image acquisition (mostly from online sources), segmentation, feature extraction, and phylogenetically informed statistical analysis to quantify aposematic color patterns in over one third of all species of Nymphalidae.
